# Single Cycle MIPS Processor in VHDL
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Single Cycle MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The Single Cycle MIPS architecture is a simple and educational design that executes each instruction in a single clock cycle.

# Key Features:
VHDL Implementation: The MIPS processor is fully described using VHDL, providing a hardware-level representation of the MIPS architecture.

Single Cycle Design: The processor is designed to execute each instruction in a single clock cycle, simplifying the pipeline structure for educational purposes.

Complete Instruction Set: The processor supports a comprehensive set of MIPS instructions, including arithmetic, logical, memory access, control flow, and other common operations.

Testbenches: A set of testbenches is provided to verify the functionality of the processor design with different instruction sequences and data inputs.

Simulation and Synthesis: Scripts and instructions are included for simulating and synthesizing the VHDL code using industry-standard tools like Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim.

# Contribution Guidelines:
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues, submit feature requests, or create pull requests with improvements or optimizations to the processor design.

# Credits:
This project is inspired by educational resources on computer architecture and VHDL, aiming to provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning about processor design and implementation.
