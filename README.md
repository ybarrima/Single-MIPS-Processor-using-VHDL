# Single-MIPS-Processor-using-VHDL
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Single Cycle MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) processor using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The Single Cycle MIPS architecture is a simple and educational design that executes each instruction in a single clock cycle.
